## Creation Process
When asked to **create** a track0r, follow this plan:

1. **Do not respond with detail in the chat window** - only create a markdown file
2. **Create (or append if already exists) a markdown file:**
   - Track0r markdown files should be placed in the folder called "track0rs"
   - The file will be named "track0r_<keyword>.md"
3. **Follow all details in the track0r_creation_guide.md file** to inform and guide the creation of the HTML file
4. **Reference the gold standard template** for structure, styling, and organization patterns

## Key Elements to Include
The gold standard includes:
- **4 main tabs**: Turn Flow, Setup, Scoring, Appendix
- **Color coding**: Blue for player actions, red for AI actions
- **Detailed tooltips**: Every step has comprehensive explanations
- **Page references**: Rulebook page numbers for verification
- **Visual hierarchy**: Main steps with detailed substeps
- **Interactive navigation**: Arrow keys and buttons
- **Professional styling**: Modern gradients and hover effects

This template provides the perfect balance of comprehensive rule coverage, user-friendly navigation, and professional presentation that should be replicated for all future track0rs.
