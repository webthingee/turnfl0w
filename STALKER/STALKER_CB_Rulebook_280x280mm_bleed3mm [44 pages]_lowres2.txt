S.T.A.L.K.E.R. UNIVERSE

S.T.A.L.K.E.R. takes place in an universe similar to ours, where additional events took place,
setting it apart. Games explore the alternative version of the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant
Exclusion Zone, full of anomalies, mutants, warring factions, and dark secrets.
The Chornobyl Nuclear Plant Exclusion Zone, or for short – the Zone came to be after the 1986
Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant accident, irradiating the area and rendering it nigh-uninhabitable.
After that, it quickly became a testbed for various clandestine experiments, culminating in
a second incident in the 2000s. The mutated subjects of those experiments roam the Zone.
Furthermore, the area is pockmarked with anomalies – spots where the usual laws of physics don’t
apply. The changed Zone attracts all kinds of people – from scientists seeking to learn its secrets,
through zealous Monolith – a brain-washed order of warriors supposedly “guarding” the Zone
against external influence, through Duty and Freedom – opposing factions, each with their own
view of the Zone and its future, to simple traders and bandits, all trying to make a profit in this
dangerous place.
You, the players, will take the role of stalkers – explorers, bounty hunters and adventurers roaming
the Zone. Most came here because of the promise of easy money, seeking wondrous artifacts –
products of anomalies affecting mundane objects and giving them various abilities. Others came
with more personal motivations – searching for a miraculous cure for their loved ones or simply
showing themselves and the world that they can survive anything the Zone throws at them.
The Chornobyl Exclusion Zone is a hostile and living microcosmos of its own. Be careful,
you who dare to enter it.

S.T.A.L.K.E.R. THE BOARD GAME
S.T.A.L.K.E.R. The Board Game is a 1-4 player fully co-op, story-based “zone”
crawler. The Campaign is played by repeating two separate parts of the game:
Zone Exploration and Missions.

RULEBOOK STRUCTURE
The rulebook is divided into the following sections:

Zone Exploration — Before each Mission you will have an opportunity to explore
the Zone, meet new people and manage all your belongings to prepare better
for the next Mission.

1.

The main gameplay components during Zone Exploration are the Campaign binder,
your Stash and the Zone Map.

3. Mission Setup in Mission guide – riefly summari es the structure
of a Mission guide and shows an example of a Mission setup.

n the ampaign binder you can find all the rules for Zone Exploration as well
as all your Contacts. All your belongings are safely hidden in the Stash.

4. Mission Map – Thoroughly covers rules about elements found on the Map tiles
and Range rules.

On the Zone ap you can find places to visit throughout the ampaign. ou will
add stickers, showing additional areas to explore.

5. Playing the Mission – Thoroughly covers the game Round order and
component rules.

Missions The main part of the gameplay is when your talkers set off for a ission,
where you will fight against Enemies, struggle with dangerous Anomalies, loot
valuables, and most importantly, fulfill ission objectives.

6. Entities Comparison – uick reference table outlining differences between
Entities.

To start a Mission you need to set it up according to the Mission guide, which
contains some insight about the tasks ahead of you, as well as instructions
on how to prepare and populate the Mission Map.
Each Mission has its own unique Map, consisting of tiles, which are divided
into spaces. Stalkers and Enemies move through those spaces. Various points
of interest will be shown on the Environment cards overlaid on the Map.
Reality-bending anomalous areas will be shown as standees residing on the foil
overlays. ometimes Enemies will fight not only you, but each other as well,
forming different teams. The Zone is a living, breathing world after all.
ou will have your Equipment to help you win the day. t is all displayed in your
trusty PDA-Personal Digital Assistant (a fancy way of saying “player board”), with
your chosen Stalker in the middle, and their Equipment distributed between various
slots – Pockets, Backpack, equipped Artifacts, worn Armor and Weapon in hand.
Each ission is played through several game Rounds, during which different
Events sway the situation and talkers and Enemies act. ou will sneak, run, loot,
and fight. All that in order to complete the ission objective.
ou will find various Actions available to you on different game components,
from your Basic Actions found on the Help card, through those provided by your
Equipment, to Environment cards allowing you to interact with your surroundings.
f you manage to complete the objective, your ission will be successful. ou will
progress the Campaign and will discover new places in the Zone. But beware, if at
least one of the Stalkers dies, or the time runs out – the Mission will end in a failure.
Apart from the Campaign, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. The Board Game can also be played
in the form of one-shot Scenarios using the Zone Survival mode. All necessary
information about the differences between the ampaign and the Z mode
can be found in the Zone Survival Rules & Scripts booklet.

2. Zone Exploration in Campaign inder – riefly summari es all steps

GOLDEN RULES
In the game like this, unclear situations can happen. In that case, follow those rules:
1.

Cards e ore Rule oo – Whenever a card’s text directly contradicts rules
found in the Rulebook, the card takes precedence.

2. Limited Components – All components are limited. f an effect would require
you to use a component that isn’t available and doesn’t specify what to do
otherwise, that part of the effect is ignored e.g., effect of an Anomaly would
cause a Stalker to lose 7HP and gain a
, but all
tokens are currently
used, the Stalker would only lose 7HP and not gain a
).
3. Uncaring Zone – Stalkers are intruders in the Zone, and the Zone reacts
almost as if it has a mind of its own. Whenever you have an unclear situation,
rule it in the player’s disfavor.

CAMPAIGN
One Campaign playthrough means playing with the group of Stalkers through
a series of consecutive Missions. Each Campaign playthrough requires a fresh
Zone Map on which you mark your progress and a separate Stash as two Stalker
groups don’t share their belongings.

STALKER COUNT
ome game effects change depending on the number of talkers taking part
in a Mission. We recommend that each player controls 1 Stalker.
If you want to add a new Stalker to the Campaign group, because e.g., you have
a new player joining you for a game night, you simply choose a talker card
for them. ou will have to equip them using the contents of your tash though.

STORIES
Each Mission in the game is a part of a Story – they provide an overarching
narrative, and their outcome will impact your Campaign. Each Story has its letter,
referred to in the Mission guide and the Zone Map, so you know that the narrative
in Mission A1 will continue in Mission A2. ou don t have to finish one tory to
begin another. ou should save the Zone ap and contents of your tash after
finishing all orebox tories. pcoming tories from the tretch oals and
expansions will use your Campaign state.

STARTING THE CAMPAIGN
To start a new ampaign perform the following tasks

5. Choose Stalkers:

1.

Each player chooses 1 Stalker card and 1 Stalker model to represent
their Stalker. Provided Stalker models are universal and are meant
to represent every Stalker, so choose whichever you want.

earn about the game

The rules of the game are explained in the following chapters
• Zone Exploration – Summarizes information about Zone
Exploration, which can be found in the ampaign binder.
• Mission Setup – Summarizes the structure of a Mission
guide and instructs how to resolve a ission setup.
• Mission Map – Thoroughly covers the ap structure.
• Playing the Mission – Thoroughly covers the game Round
order and component rules.

You may choose any available Stalkers but there are four
talkers recommended for the first playthrough
• Borsuk, a Zone explorer
•
amon, a lone fighter
• Milady, a sneaky sniper
• Velet, a versatile tank

2. Check the Gameplay Example:

Those chosen talkers will remain with you for the whole ampaign.

Play out the short scenario found in the Gameplay Example
to check your understanding of the game.

Then, each player chooses one color and takes the following
components in that color:
• PDA
• Attention token
• Plastic ring

3. Take out the ampaign binder, tash plastic envelope and
Zone Map from the box.
They will be used during the Zone Exploration part of the game.

Place the plastic ring on the talker s model. Place the talker
card in the middle of the PDA and the Attention token in the slot
near Pockets.

Replaying the Campaign

ZONE EXPLORATION IN CAMPAIGN BINDER

Achievments

Before each Mission, you perform Zone Exploration using the Campaign binder and the Zone Map. You explore the Zone,
make use of some of the Contacts gained throughout the Campaign, and manage your Equipment.
Detailed instructions of Zone Exploration steps are found in the Campaign binder which is the main component you will be using
in this phase.

Zone Exploration Summary

There are three types o locations ound on the Zone Map

During Zone Exploration each of these steps will be resolved fully,
in this order:
1.

Zone Navigation – Here you visit locations on the Zone Map.
One of these locations will be your next Mission. Choosing
it gives you the story introduction, but doesn’t start
the Mission immediately.

2. Contacts – Here you interact with the Contacts you have
met during the Campaign. They will help you during your
Missions and allow you to buy and sell Equipment.
3. Going on a Mission – Here you perform all necessary steps
to prepare Stalkers for the Mission. It redirects you to
the Mission guide where you setup the Mission.
4. Post Mission Cleanup – This step is performed after
the Mission and contains instructions for clearing the table.

ZONE NAVIGATION
The Zone is vast and provides many opportunities. Which places
you visit is your decision. At the beginning your options are
limited, but after each Mission new stickers with new points
of interest will be added to your Zone Map. During each Zone
Navigation you must visit 1 Mission location and you may visit up
to 1 New Contact or Stash location.

New Contacts – Marked in green, they represent new Contacts
you can meet in the Zone. any of them are traders or offer other
unique services. Choosing this point of interest will usually result
in giving you a new Contact card. When you choose this option
read the specified script which can be found in the criptbook
(back of the Mission guide).
Stashes – Marked in blue, they represent well hidden inventories
of other Stalkers, potentially containing Equipment that’s hard
to obtain. Choosing this option will usually give you a choice
of obtaining some Equipment, sometimes at a cost. When you
choose this option read the specified script which can be found
in the Scriptbook (back of the Mission guide).
Missions – Marked in red, they represent your possible next
ission. hen you choose this option read the specified page
of the Mission guide which will brief you on what you can expect
from the next Mission. Choosing a Mission doesn’t immediately
start it, but you won’t be able to pick another one. Before
the Mission begins you will have an option to explore the Zone
more, make use of your Contacts and prepare your gear.

Marking Locations
Most of the scripts and some Mission Epilogues ask you to mark
a location. To do so, simply cross out that location using a pen or
pencil. Do it only when asked to.
Marked Locations can’t be visited. They are already completed
and are unavailable in this Campaign.

Stickers
When you are instructed to update your Zone Map with a sticker,
find it on the sticker sheet and stick it to the ap in the correct
place. Each sticker contains one distinctive feature with
its counterpart on the Zone ap which can help you to find
the correct place for a sticker.

CONTACTS

Buying and Selling

Contact cards represent various Characters (and animals) met
throughout the Campaign. During each Zone Management you
may choose and resolve up to three Contact cards that you
have slotted in the cardholder of your Campaign binder.

Before the Mission you will have the option to trade with
different ontacts. e advise to carefully consider your options
here as correct preparation and better Equipment can make
a Mission much easier to beat.

There are four types of Contact cards:
• Loners – They offer small task services sometimes out
of good will, but usually they demand a considerable payment.
• Traders – They buy and sell various Equipment. Thanks to
them you can easily upgrade your gear which is essential to
survive in the Zone.
• Companions – ou may take up to
ompanion on
a ission. onsider choosing a ompanion if you think you
might need a helping hand on a Mission.
• Contracts – ou may take up to
ontract on a ission.
They provide you with an additional objective which rewards
you with on completion.

henever you buy or sell Equipment usually by visiting
a Trader), you gain or discard Coupons equal to the good’s
value. Usually this is the value visible on a card, but
sometimes the Trader modifies it e.g., idorovich sells tems
for twice their
value and is willing to buy Equipment cards
from you for only quarter of their
value).

• You may buy Items for twice their value.
• You may buy “Echo Detector” Attachments
for their value.

hen you buy something, find it and place it in your tash
(or if you want you may immediatelly equip it on your PDA).
hen you sell something, discard it and return it to the correct
deck or token compartment.

GOING ON A MISSION
Before you depart on a Mission you should prepare yourself.
ou want to strike a balance between space for any loot you
may find and preparing for any number of troubles. After all,
a prepared talker is a living talker.
This is the moment when you decide which talker equips what.
Each talker should have at least Armor and
eapon at all
times so be sure to equip yourselves properly. Additionally these
steps will be performed before each Mission:
• Each talker sets their P to their ax value.
• Each talker packs few olts in their Pockets and Focuses
on the Mission.
• Each eapon is fully loaded.
• Each talker sets the Radiation dosage on their eiger counter.

etectors and Arti acts
Artifacts are the most powerful
and most precious objects
in the Zone. To obtain them
from Anomalies you will need
at least Detector Attachment
card in your team. Although it’s
not necessary for the Mission,
gathering Artifacts is usually
worth the trouble.

POST MISSION CLEANUP
1.

Name – Each Contact has a unique name.

2. Type – Each Contact has one of the four Contact types.
3. Number – Each Contact has a number in its top right corner.
Contact numbers start with the letter C.
4. Story – A bit of lore about that character.
5. Rules – Depending on the Contact type this can be
a single use effect, buy sell offer or instructions on how to
use this during a Mission.

Double Faced Cards
Companions and Contracts are double faced cards. On their
“a” side there are instructions you resolve during Zone
Exploration. On their “b” side there are rules that are applied
during the ission. During Zone Exploration you may freely look
at both sides before you decide to choose that Contact.

After each Mission you will have an option to save your
Campaign or to continue playing.

STASH
During the Campaign, you may gain loads of Equipment and
Coupons, either by completing Missions, scavenging them from
hidden stashes or simply from trading with Contacts. As long as
you are resolving the Zone Exploration all your belongings are
available to you.
After you prepare for a Mission any pieces of Equipment
that you don t want to take on a ission or simply can t due
to limits can be safely placed in a tash and will patiently wait
for your return.

MISSION SETUP IN MISSION GUIDE

During each Zone Exploration you choose one Mission you will embark on. All information about Missions can be found in the Mission
guide booklet and is split into three sections:

PROLOGUE

MISSION MAP EXAMPLE AFTER SETUP
1.

Map tiles – Each Mission Map consists of several Map tiles
showing you where the Mission will take place. Be careful
to orient them as shown on the setup diagram. The numbers
of required tiles will help you find the correct way of placing
Map tiles.

2B

2. Environment cards – n each ission box you can find
a dedicated, unique Environment deck. Do not look through
the contents of those cards (unless instructed) and always
place them on the side specified by the setup, otherwise
you might spoil the Mission for yourself! During setup
the Environment cards are divided into three categories:

1
5A

5B
3B

A. Note cards – These cards are placed next to the Map
and contain your Mission Objectives, new rules and
information necessary for the Mission.

5C

6

B. Map overlays – These cards are placed directly on the Map,
changing its contents and allowing you to interact with
them in various ways. All overlay cards with text have it
oriented in the same way – this will help you to place them
correctly on the Mission Map.

7

C. Environment deck – Cards not placed during setup are
stacked in a deck and placed next to the Map. During
the ission you will be instructed to find specified cards
in that deck.

8
2A

3. Anomalies – Each Mission will contain at least one Anomaly.
Anomalies consist of the following components:

4

A. Anomaly card – They contain rules regarding Anomaly
effects and should be placed next to the ap.

2C

B. Anomaly overlay – Setup will instruct you which
overlays you should use and where to place them,
marking the exact spot of the Anomaly Centers.
C. Anomaly standee and Artifact token – Setup will
instruct you in which Anomaly Centers you should place
Anomaly standees and .
4. Stalker’s Starting Point – Each ission specifies a starting
space or spaces where you place your Stalkers.
5. Enemies – Each Mission will contain at least one Enemy.
Enemies are represented by the following components:
A. Enemy card – Placed next to the Map and marked
with at least one Enemy team token (
)
defined by the setup. The card contains all the Enemy
rules and statistics, like their Sight Range, Move value,
and Attack. The color token influences their behaviour
and decides their team allegiance.
B. Starting Enemies – Most Enemies are immediately placed
on the Map. This point tells you where to place the Enemy
standees. It is important to have them facing in the right
direction, as shown by the arrows on the setup diagram.

3C

3A

6. Loot tokens ( ) – Piles of stuff ready to be picked up.
It might be an Item, some Bolts, a lone Artifact stashed away
or even a Weapon. Most of the time you will be placing those
tokens in stacks, more than 1 on the space.
7.

Unknown tokens ( ) – These tokens represent Enemy
reinforcements and mark spaces where the Enemies might
come from.

8. Event deck – Deck of Event cards which narrates
the ission for you. n each ission box you can find
dedicated, unique Mission Event cards that create your
starting Event deck for that Mission. Additionally during
the Mission you will add some Random Events to this
deck. The Event deck marks the passage of time, limiting
the number of Rounds that are available during a Mission, so
every time you are adding Random Events to the deck, you
gain time to finish that ission.

C. Enemy pool – Some Enemies are placed next to
the Map and can arrive later when you resolve
Unknown tokens (
).

CLOSEST OBJECT AND SHORTEST ROUTE

Range is always measured between two spaces. It is equal to
the lowest number of edges crossed between those spaces.
Range doesn’t have to be measured in a straight line. Here are
examples of different Ranges

To find which object is the closest one to something follow
these rules
1.

isuali e the shortest route for each compared object
(containing the least number of spaces in between).
A. Human Enemies ignore all routes containing uncovered

Line of Sight (LoS)

Sight
Back

Line of Sight (LoS) is determining whether two Entities on
the Map are able to see each other. LoS is always measured
between two spaces. In order to determine if there is a LoS
between the spaces of those two Entities you have to:
• For Stalkers check all cardinal directions (front, back, left and
right), for Enemies check directions depending on their Sight.
• LoS in each cardinal direction should be checked individually.
To do so, check spaces that are horizontally or vertically
(depending on the cardinal direction checked) connected
to the Entity’s space. Then, for each such space, repeat
this process in the same cardinal direction until you reach
the edge of the Map, the end of Sight Range or you encounter
a o blocking effect a all or o isibility token ). In other
words you could compare LoS to all spaces that you could
reach with Movement without the need to change direction.
• An Entity always has a LoS to it’s own space.
• An Entity has Line of Sight to all those spaces and can
therefore see each Entity present in those spaces.
• Entities, Anomalies, and most tokens do not block the Line
of Sight unless it’s clearly stated!

Sides

Sides
Front

Enemies have different o
Ranges depending on their
facing. A talker s o has
Range in each direction.

Example:
ta ker has in nite ight ange in a directions.
Standing on this particular space, the blue Stalker has LoS
to 10 spaces in front of them, 2 spaces to the left,
2 spaces to the right and 0 spaces in the back as there’s
a Wall behind them. So the blue Stalker can see
a
andit hotgunners but can t see the
andit i emen.

Example: A Bandit has the following Sight Ranges: 3 in front, 1 on sides
and 0 in back. Standing on this particular space and facing downwards
the Bandit has LoS to 3 spaces in front of them, 2 spaces to the left
and 2 spaces to the right. So this Bandit has LoS to the green and blue
Stalkers but doesn’t have LoS to the gray Stalker (reaching that space
would require changing the direction) and purple Stalker
(they are on the space to the back of the Bandit where they have LoS 0).

Example: Standing on this particular space, the blue Stalker has LoS
to 5 spaces in front of them, 1 space to the left and 3 spaces to the right.
So the blue Stalker sees 2 of 4 Bandits.

PLAYING THE MISSION

Missions are various tasks you will undertake during your Campaign. They have story connections between each other and are played
on the ap constructed from ap tiles and populated with different components during setup.

MISSION OBJECTIVE

Active Event
Only one Event can be active
at any time. henever an effect
causes you to draw find
an Event card, place it on top
of the previous Active Event.

Each Mission has a main Objective card which summarizes your
goal during that ission. ou have to fulfill it in order to succeed.
Additionally, it contains information regarding, what happens
whenever a Stalker dies.
In most Missions a Stalker’s death is equal to the failure of
a ission and requires you to go to a specific ission Event card
which explains the next steps.

Players Phase

ACTIONS

Lead Stalker

From taking a few steps to headshotting a Bandit, each Action is
important and can impact the whole Mission.

During this Phase, Stalkers carry out their Turns one at a time
in a clockwise order. Each Round starts with the Turn of
the Lead Stalker.

Lead Stalker is a moving title
tied to one Stalker at a time.
See more on page 24.

One Action must be finished before the next one can begin.

In a given Round each Stalker carries out two Turns in total
(each represented by one Turn token) and during each Turn they
perform 2 Standard Actions (
).
hen all talkers have finished both of their Turns, proceed to
the Enemies & Zone Phase.

Basic Actions are Actions known to every Stalker and are
explained in detail on the following pages. Other sources
of Actions are the Environment cards on the Mission Map and
the Equipment cards you ve obtained e.g., different eapons,
grenades, med-kits).
Actions are represented by two different icons

TURNS

Gameplay Example
ou can check the flow
of the gameplay in the small
ameplay Example booklet.

Standard Action – To perform this kind of Action you must
slide your Turn token one slot down. They are relatively simple
Actions, like moving a few meters, lobbing a grenade or taking
a shot from a gun, but there’s a limit to how much you can do
during a short span of time.

Example: On the left – Turn tokens before performing any
.
n the midd e
urn token after erforming the rst
of that Turn.
On the right – Turn token after performing the second
of that Turn.
When Stalker decides they don’t want to perform any
their Turn ends
and Enemies that have them in their LoS can React.

Free Action – They don’t require you to slide your Turn
token. You can perform any number of Free Actions during
your Turn, before, after or in between your two Standard
Actions. They represent Actions that can be performed without
any preparation, like taking a peek through a window inside
a building, opening doors or chugging an energy drink.

markers in Turn tokens
ome effects can place
or more on your Turn token.
They increase the number
of
you can perform during
that Turn. henever you
perform
while you have at
least
on your current Turn
token, you must discard
instead of sliding the Turn token
down. During the End of Round,
Stalkers discard any
remaining on their Turn tokens.

Each Turn is represented by one of the two Turn tokens
on a Stalker’s PDA. During a Turn, only the Active Stalker
performs Actions.
One Turn must be finished before the next one can begin.
During each Turn, a Stalker must perform 2 Standard Actions (
and may perform an unlimited number of Free Actions ( ).
Each time a Stalker performs a Standard Action, they slide
their Turn token down once. hen a Turn token reaches
the bottom slot and they don’t want to perform any additional
Free Actions (
, their Turn is finished.

)

End of Stalker’s Turn
After each Stalker’s Turn, Enemies with a Line of Sight to that
Stalker will have a chance to React by Attacking them. This
information is reminded on the PDA when a Turn token reaches
the bottom slot. More about Enemy’s Reaction on page 34.
Passing the Turn
A player may decide, before their Stalker’s Turn begins, to pass.
n that case, proceed with the Turn of the next talker. ou
don’t lose your Turn when you pass. It means that you can freely
postpone your Turn and wait for a better situation to utilize your
Actions, but you have to carry out your Turns eventually.

BASIC ACTIONS

Prepare:

Each Stalker always has access to the following Actions. They
are also listed on the Help card.
Movement:
ometimes a you can do is run as fast as you can
Move up to 3 spaces.
The most common Action used to traverse through the Mission
Map. This Movement results in moving/placing your Attention
token.
Careful Movement:
ome situations ca for a carefu and si ent a

roach.

You can’t perform this Action to Move from or to Enemy LoS.
Move 1 space. Don’t move/place your Attention token.
Stalker Movement Rules
ovement may come in different forms and from different
sources. Regardless of the Movement source, all Stalker
Moves follow the following rules:
• To Move X spaces, simply Move your Stalker to an adjacent
space X times. Spaces divided with Impassable Terrain
or a Wall
without a Window
aren’t
considered adjacent.
• If you enter a space with an Enemy, your Movement is
interrupted and you must immediately end it.
• If you would end your Movement on a fully occupied space,
Push one of the Entities from that space talkers first,
if present) to an adjacent space (the one you Moved from,
if possible). If no Entity could be Pushed to create a slot
for you, you can’t end your Movement in such a space.
• You may Move through fully occupied spaces without
Enemies.
• If you Move from a space with an Enemy, rotate the Enemy
standee to face the adjacent space you Move to.

Push
Push is an involuntary form
of Movement that can’t be
interrupted. When an Enemy is
Pushed, rotate their standee so
they are facing the space they
moved from.

• If you Move through a space in an Enemy’s LoS, place
your
on the first space you are oving through that is
no longer in an Enemy’s LoS.
• If you end your Movement in an Enemy’s LoS, place your
on your space.
• If you end your Movement and your
isn’t placed on
the Map, move/place your
on your space.

Some Actions specify that you
Move without moving or
placing the Attention token.
In such cases you only move
or place your Attention token
if you end that Movement
in an Enemy’s LoS.

Radiation
• If the Movement caused you to slide one of your Turn tokens
down and you Moved to, from, or through one or more
spaces with , you increase your Radiation dosage equal to
the highest value of the
found on those spaces. This value
can be reduced by your Armor s ap Radiation modifier.
Triggers
During the Movement, check if you’ve entered a space with
a
or a space with Anomaly symbols (
) and
resolve triggered effects. f the
effect applies immediately
and doesn’t specify that it ends the Movement you may
continue the Movement after fully resolving the
effect.

Then, any number of times in any order, Stalkers on your space
may:
• Exchange an Artifact, Attachment, Armor, Item, Weapon,
Magazine,
, or Personal Important Finding (subtype
of Note cards found during a Mission) with another Stalker
on the same space.
• Move a Weapon from the Weapon slot to the Backpack
and vice versa. Ammo stays on the Weapon.
• Move an Armor from the Armor slot to the Backpack

Each time you slide your Turn token down (usually by
performing
), if you are/were present during the Action on
any space with
(Radiation), increase your Radiation dosage
by the highest value of the
found on spaces where you are/
were present during that Action. Your Armor’s Map Radiation
modifier can reduce this.
Geiger Counter & Radiation Dosage

Many Actions will cause you to place your Attention token
on the Map, attracting Enemies toward you. With passage
of time, Attention will fade, thus allowing you to use it tactically.
Placing Attention doesn’t immediately cause Enemies to react,
but influences their behaviour during the Enemy Activation step.
Low Attention – Symbolises noises and other signs of your
presence that Enemies may ignore, like moving a few steps too
fast or dealing a lethal blow with a silenced Weapon. If there
are only
tokens on the Map or none at all, Enemies won’t
necessarily follow your steps and may continue their own patrols.
High Attention – Symbolises noises and other signs of your
presence that Enemies will follow. Shooting with a Weapon
or moving right before their eyes, these Actions will alert
Enemies and make them try to find you. f there is at least
on the ap, Enemies behavior will become more aggressive and
more focused on the source of the Attention.

Lead Stalker

Armor

Every group needs a leader.

Armor provides protection from Enemy Attacks and sometimes
will even reduce the Radiation dosage you gain. ou may only
have Armor equipped at a time and you may keep additional
ones in your ackpack. t is advised for each talker to have
at least Armor at all times as the Zone can be a merciless place.
Although Armor comes in different shapes and forms they share
some common characteristics.

Lead Stalker is a moving title tied to one Stalker at a time. Some
game effects e.g., found on Events refer to a ead talker.
The ead talker also has the final voice in case of unresolved
disputes between players.

powerful special abilities at the cost of exposing them to Radiation.
Artifacts can be safely transported in your Backpack, but if you

STALKER ATTACK

Count the

of the targeted ody Part. Resolve the effect of the highest
reached threshold of that Body Part.
If you’re performing a Weapon Attack within Accurate Range,
remember to treat
as 4 .
f the effect is a ight or eavy ound, draw an Enemy
Wound card and apply the corresponding outcome.
If you did not reach any threshold, your Attack misses.
If you have any unspent , this is the last time you may
spend them to apply additional effects.

Lead is a currency of its own.
Attacks are Actions that allow you to engage Enemies. They are
commonly found on eapons and sometimes on different cards
e.g., Frag renade tem . Additionally there is one asic Attack
Action: the Knife Action.
In order to perform an Attack your Stalker usually has to have
Range and or o to the target s space.
nless otherwise stated you may only target Enemy models
with an Attack.

Attack Sequence
To perform an Attack follow these steps:
1.

Choose an Attack Action and a valid Target.
When Attacking with a Weapon the Target must be within
the eapon s ax. Range and in o .
Additionally, some Weapon Attacks state a minimum
Range to the Target.
Non-Weapon Attacks specify the Range within which
they may be performed and if the Target must be in o .

2. Remember to slide the Turn token if the Attack is a
and spend Ammo if needed.
3. Place the required Attention token.
If the Attack places the Attention token and doesn’t
specify where, place it on your space.
If the Attack places
and you have your
anywhere
on the Map, do not place the
.
Remember that if you re in an Enemy s o you always
have your
on your space.
4. Target a Body Part:
If the Attack allows you to pick the Body Part, do so now.
Otherwise, target Torso.
ody Parts have different To it tables, providing balance
between the di culty of a it and its effect.
5. Roll the dice:
When Attacking with a Weapon, roll
presented on your
Stalker card and additional
specified by the eapon s
Attack.
Non-Weapon Attacks specify the number of
and/or

ENEMY WOUNDS

Enemy pool
At the start of each Mission
and whenever a new Enemy
appears in a Mission, you will be
instructed to prepare a specific
number of Enemy standees.
Some of them may be placed
on the Map and some may be
left next to it.

ometimes a you can do, is shoot and ho e for the best.
henever an Enemy suffers a ight or eavy ound usually
caused by Attacks or Anomaly effects , draw the top
card of the Enemy ounds deck and resolve the effects
corresponding to the type of the ound that Enemy suffered.
After you resolve an Enemy Wound card, discard it.
There are six different possible outcomes from resolving
an Enemy Wound card:

Overall they create a given
Enemy’s standee pool. This
limits how many standees
of an Enemy there can be at

Enemies & Zone Phase

During this Phase you perform various tasks marking
the passage of time. ou feel the effects of the Radiation
you ve accumulated during your adventures, temporary effects
vanish, new Enemies may appear, but most importantly Enemies
Activate giving them a chance to hunt you down.

When resolving Enemy Activation cards, conclude each point
from top to bottom. Each point must be resolved one Enemy at
a time and must be fully resolved before continuing to the next
point. If multiple Enemies should be Activated, do so starting
with those closest to the point of interest (usually it will be
the closest Attention token). In case of a tie we recommend
to Activate them in the following order:

During this Phase, steps are resolved in the following order:

B. Elite
– Tough and hard hitting, but there’s only a few.
Their spawns are usually limited.

• Special usually

Enemy Tokens and Teams
Most Enemies, when added to a Mission, are marked with an Enemy
token in one of four colors, which will differentiate their behavior
(based on the Enemy Activation cards).
Enemies are boss-like monsters and lethally dangerous
individuals.

C. Boss
– Very rare and dangerous Enemies. Sometimes
it’s wiser to leave them alone, but if you’re forced to
fight you d better prepare a good plan.

Enemies are elite guards, enforcers and mutants hunting
in small groups.

3. Type – Each Enemy has at least 1 type that describes them.
ome game effects may reference those keywords and they
incorporate some rules differences between Enemies.

Enemies are pack mutants and groups of humans
(like bandits).
Enemies are horde Enemies, with little in the way
of coordination and relying on numbers.

4. Movement – Base Movement value. When this Enemy
“Moves up to
”, Move up to that many spaces.
5. Hit Points – Most Enemies in Stalker have 1
and a single
precise shot is enough to take them down.
Enemies tend
to have more
requiring a more careful approach. When
an Enemy is reduced to 0
they die.
6. Sight – Enemies can detect you from different distances. This
grid depicts how many spaces in each direction a given Enemy
sees. If you are in that Range, you are in that Enemy’s LoS.
The side with a triangle marks the front facing of the Enemy.
7.

Attack – Each Enemy has one available Attack.

be performed during the resolution of certain
Enemy
Activation cards.

Enemy tokens have two sides. One marked with “1” and the other
marked with “2”. Enemies marked with tokens with the same

ENEMY MOVEMENT RULES

Rotation during Movement
When an Enemy Moves
to an adjacent space
they always do so facing
that space. To accomplish
that sometimes the Enemy
has to be rotated before
that Movement. Rotation
doesn’t decrease the number
of spaces that the Enemy
is allowed to Move, but may
cause the Movement to be
interrupted.

There are two types of Movement that Enemies perform:
Move – When Enemies Move they do so toward a target,
choosing the shortest route. Enemies follow the chosen route
rotating towards the space they will Move to, before performing
the Movement. They will repeat this as many times as the Move
Action indicates, stopping when they reach their target
space or Moving the maximum distance. If they didn’t reach
their destination and aren’t currently facing in the direction
that they would continue their Movement, rotate them towards
that direction.
Go forward – Go forward means that Enemies are patrolling
around without paying mind to their surroundings too much.
When Enemies are asked to Go forward, the Enemy goes directly
ahead, rotating by 90° only if they can’t proceed farther. In such
cases, they rotate the least number of times (clockwise in case
of a tie), until they can Go forward again.

Shortest route
Shortest route is the one
requiring to Move the least
number of spaces. If multiple
routes require the same number
of spaces, follow the tiebreakers
found on page 14.

Move and Go forward keywords are always accompanied by
the numeric value representing the amount of spaces the model
can Move. This value is sometimes indicated with the
icon
which refers to the Movement value printed on the Enemy card.

Example: The Snork Moves toward the green Stalker’s
.
During the Movement, the Snork gains LoS to the green Stalker.
Its Movement is immediately interrupted and as it now has LoS
to the green Stalker their
must be placed on their space.

Enemy Movement and Fully Occupied Spaces
Enemies can’t end their Movement in a fully occupied space.
If it would happen, that Enemy ends their Movement in
an adjacent space along the Movement route. If it’s also a fully
occupied space, the Enemy chooses the next shortest route to
perform that Movement instead.
Enemies can Move through fully occupied spaces without
possible Targets, but when doing so, they can’t be interrupted
on that space.

SPECIAL

Go forward 1.
At any point duringBraindead:
the Movement,
if an Enemy gains LoS
to a possible Target, or if they already had LoS to a Target,
immediately end their Movement (e.g., if an Enemy should Move
but they already have a Target in LoS they won’t even rotate).
Some forms of Movement specify that they can’t be interrupted.
Interruption doesn’t cause Enemies to immediately Attack or
perform any other Action.

If an interruption occured during the resolution of an Enemy
Activation card continue to resolve it normally.
High Attention
Whenever an Enemy gains LoS to a Stalker, that Stalker must
place their

Enemy Reaction
If you keep standing in your enemy’s view, don’t expect them
to do nothing.
After each Stalker Turn, Enemies with LoS to that Stalker will
have a chance to React, by Attacking. Only the Stalker whose
Turn just ended can be a Target for an Enemy’s Reaction
(unless otherwise stated by the Enemy card).

Example 1: The blue Stalker ends their Turn in LoS of a Bandit.
Even though the green Stalker is closer to the Bandit and also in their LoS,
only the blue Stalker will be Attacked by the Bandit.

Example: The Snork Attacks the gray Stalker. The Snork’s
is 8.
Now it’s Stalker’s time to Defend. Even though gray Stalker
is on a space with
they don’t gain its bonus as the Attack
was made from the same Room. Leather Jacket Armor provides
gray Stalker with 1
for Defense rolls. They check for any other
possible bonuses. Their Stone Flower Artifact allows them
to roll 2 additional
, but they will also gain a
. They decide to do so,
so they gain a
and roll the total of 3
for Defense. The result
of the roll is 1
,3
, and no
. They decide to spend their
to reroll the dice with 1
and no
. The reroll result is 1
and 2
.
he na outcome is
rolled for Defense so compared to 8
it means that the gray Stalker loses 2HP so they reduce their HP
from to .

Example 2: The blue Stalker ends their Turn in LoS of a Pseudogiant.
As a part of the Pseudogiant’s Attack it Charges
to the blue Stalker’s space. Its Attack states that it Attacks all Targets
on one space so both blue Stalker and green Stalker will be Attacked.

ENEMY FACING
t s important to properly place Enemies as their facing influences
their Line of Sight. Enemy standees have an art in front and black
background in back.
Additionally you may use provided orange triangle stickers
(that resemble the front of the Sight cross) to mark the front on
the standee bases.

Example: ront and back of a andit with a i e.

During a Mission, Stalkers can accumulate Radiation dosage
by entering irradiated areas and staying there too long.
During this step, each Stalker on the yellow, orange, red, or black
threshold on their eiger counter, suffers from Radiation Exposure.
Then, each Stalker reduces their Radiation dosage until they
reach the next lower .

ATTENTION REDUCTION
Even the most alert enemy will not hunt you forever.

Then, each talker below their Artifact s base Radiation dosage
increases their Radiation dosage to match that value.

Anomalies

ere s an example o an Anomaly o erlay on the Map

Anomalies are areas, found exclusively in the Zone, that defy
the laws of physics. At least the ones we know of. Not all areas
are a ected e ua y though, and e erienced ta kers are ab e
to carefully traverse them.

hat said, noma ies are e treme y dangerous, but are a so

Anomaly die
The Anomaly die is a D10 with
the following sides:

Anomalies are represented by a few game components:
• Anomaly card – Describes detailed rules of the specific
Anomaly, explaining the effects of the Anomaly and how it
affects Entities entering its area.
• Anomaly o erlay ith Anomaly standee – An Anomaly
overlay is a foil with Anomaly symbols, which delineates
the area of effect of said Anomaly. n the center of each
Anomaly overlay resides a standee dedicated to that Anomaly.

Any symbols currently covered by
,
, or Entities are ignored
(but each instance of a symbol must be covered separately).
Each different Anomaly symbol an Entity oves through
increases the chance of the Anomaly Activating. oving through
the same symbol multiple times does nothing however.

RETRIEVING ARTIFACTS FROM ANOMALIES
Most rtifacts originate around owerfu noma ies. o nd them,
Stalkers use various detectors to pinpoint their exact location.
During the game, Artifacts always start placed under the Anomaly
standees. They can t be picked up until you use an Action
from a Detector Attachment card to pinpoint the Artifact s
location, placing the Artifact token on a specified Anomaly symbol
where it can be obtained using the Pick up asic Action.
henever you perform the Pick up asic Action to resolve an
gain an Artifact card with the Artifact type corresponding to
the type of an Anomaly from which you pick up the Artifact.

,

Example: The blue Stalker decided to perform a risky Movement.
They Moved through a space with

on a space with

Blocking Anomaly Symbols
There are three basic ways to block an Anomaly symbol
•
placed on it usually by performing the olts & uts
asic Action .
•
placed on it usually by taking it from under the Anomaly
with the help of a Detector Attachment .
• An Entity ends their ovement or is placed on a space with
an Anomaly symbol. After they roll the
for the Anomaly
Activation, the Entity covers the highest uncovered symbol
possible
.
A space is still treated as an Anomaly space, even if all symbols
are covered. The same way Anomaly symbols are still treated as
being there – the coverage of them only affects the probability
of Activating the Anomaly.

Example: On the eft icture, the s ace inside this shack has a
chance of triggering this Anomaly as it contains all types of symbols
(2 of each). On the right picture, two Entities and 2

is reduced to ust

Single Stalker Mode

Real stalkers seldom go out in groups. Too many guys to divide
the loot. Real professionals go into the Zone alone.
For solo players it is strongly recommended to play with only
single Stalker. Themes of loneliness in face of uncaring world
are strong in the whole S.T.A.L.K.E.R. universe and playing more
than 1 Stalker per player tends to dillute that atmosphere.

TURN OVERLAYS
While playing with only 1 Stalker in your team, place the special
Turn overlays on your PDA on which you will slide Turn tokens.
This overlay allows you to perform 3
instead of 2 during each
of your Turns for a total of 6
during each Round.

Each Enemy with LoS
to your Stalker
Attacks your Stalker.

Each Enemy with LoS
to your Stalker
Attacks your Stalker.

LEAD STALKER
You are the Lead Stalker at all times so you never lose it. Still,
when you perform the
from the ead talker token, you flip it
and it is unflipped from the Event card s End of Round effect.

CRITICAL INJURY
When you gain a Critical Injury you place it in the same spot as
usual. Notice that on the Turn overlay it covers 2 slots so by
gaining it you lose 2
during that Turn!

Lost Territories

Reaching the Lost Territory

If you think you know the Zone, all its nooks and crannies, that’s
the moment you have to be extra careful. Experienced Stalkers
are full of cautionary tales about well trodden paths suddenly
eading into unknown noma y e ds and ost sou s wandering
the Red Forest. And for a good reason.
Lost Territories is an optional expansion adding new areas you
can access during your Campaign or Zone Survival Scenarios.
Its use is completely optional, though some Missions may ask
you to use Lost Territories components.
You can add Lost Territories to any Campaign Mission or Zone
Survival Scenario.

Each Lost Territory tile contains an Entrance. Additionally,
a Setup card will have you place 1 Entrance token on the Map.
Spaces with a Lost Territories Entrance are counted as adjacent
for purposes of Movement and measuring Range for all Entities,
but you can’t draw a Line of Sight “through” the Entrance token.
So you may throw a Grenade or Bolt between the Lost Territory
tile and the Map and the Enemies may follow you there, but you
can’t Attack with a Weapon as it requires LoS.
