# Course of Action: Unit Skills Tab Implementation

## Summary
Add a new "Unit Skills" tab to the existing Hoplomachus Victorum track0r interface that displays the unit skills information from the CSV file in an organized, searchable format.

## Steps of the Course of Action

1. **Analyze Current Structure**
   - Examine existing tab implementation in track0r_HV_Pandora_Mercury.html
   - Understand the tab navigation system and content structure
   - Identify the pattern for adding new tabs

2. **Design Unit Skills Tab Layout**
   - Create a new tab button labeled "Unit Skills"
   - Design the content structure with selector and details panels
   - Plan the organization of skills (by type, alphabetical, etc.)

3. **Parse and Structure CSV Data**
   - Read the unit_skills.csv file
   - Parse the three columns: SKILL, TYPE, RULES
   - Organize skills by type (Innate, Special, Ability)
   - Create searchable/filterable structure

4. **Implement Tab Content**
   - Add new tab button to navigation
   - Create tab content div with proper structure
   - Implement selector list with skill names
   - Create details panel showing skill information

5. **Add JavaScript Functionality**
   - Extend existing tab switching logic
   - Add skill filtering/search capabilities
   - Implement skill type filtering
   - Add keyboard navigation support

6. **Style and Format**
   - Apply consistent styling with existing tabs
   - Format skill rules with proper emphasis
   - Add visual indicators for skill types
   - Ensure responsive design

7. **Test and Refine**
   - Test tab switching functionality
   - Verify skill information display
   - Check keyboard navigation
   - Ensure mobile compatibility

## Resources Needed

- Existing track0r_HV_Pandora_Mercury.html file
- unit_skills.csv file with skill data
- Text editor for HTML/CSS/JavaScript modifications
- Web browser for testing

## Risks of the Course of Action

- **Data Parsing Issues**: CSV format might have special characters or formatting that needs handling
- **JavaScript Conflicts**: New code might interfere with existing tab functionality
- **Performance**: Large number of skills might impact page load time
- **Maintenance**: Future updates to skills would require manual CSV updates

## Benefits of the Course of Action

- **Quick Reference**: Players can quickly look up skill rules during gameplay
- **Organized Information**: Skills are categorized by type for easy browsing
- **Searchable**: Players can find specific skills quickly
- **Consistent Interface**: Maintains the existing track0r design patterns
- **Offline Access**: No internet required for skill lookups

## Alternatives to the Course of Action

1. **Separate HTML File**: Create a standalone unit skills reference page
2. **PDF Reference**: Convert skills to a printable PDF document
3. **Mobile App**: Create a dedicated mobile app for skill lookups
4. **Physical Cards**: Print skill cards for tabletop reference

## Conclusion

Adding a Unit Skills tab to the existing track0r interface is the most practical solution. It leverages the existing infrastructure, provides immediate value to players, and maintains consistency with the current design. The implementation is straightforward and builds on proven patterns.
