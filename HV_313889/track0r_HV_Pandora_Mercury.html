        <div class="substep" data-detail="When you accept an Opportunity event, draw up to three cards from the Opportunity Deck, ensuring you do not exceed your Opportunity Capacity as indicated on your hero tracking pad.

        <div class="substep" data-detail="You may discard an Opportunity card during combat directly after the die roll of any non-scion unit – yours or a rival. This causes the entire roll to be re-rolled. You must accept the new roll (or spend another Opportunity for another re-roll). This re-roll happens before any skill or effect is triggered off of the die roll. (Mercury Boots Rulesheet p. 8)">2.6 Combat - Opportunity Re-rolls</div>
        
        <div class="substep" data-detail="Opportunities can be spent when collecting primus rewards for the reward on the card. See Primus Rewards section for more details.

        <div class="substep" data-detail="When the tribune is defeated, your hero's HP is not reduced. Instead, you immediately gain scion influence equal to the current act.

        <div class="substep" data-detail="Bloodshed events are carried out as normal.

        <div class="substep" data-detail="You may challenge any number of primuses, up to all 7, during your journey. Challenge a primus as normal by landing on a capital location containing an undefeated primus. Defeating a primus grants massive rewards which will help your hero take a big step forward. (Mercury Boots Rulesheet p. 10)">2.10 Combat - Primuses</div>
        
        <div class="substep" data-detail="Each time you defeat a primus, you add a modifier which will apply to all combats for the remainder of the game, including primus combats, with the exception of the scion combat. Primus modifiers are cumulative. If an event card instructs you to ignore act modifiers, ignore primus modifiers for that event. (Mercury Boots Rulesheet p. 11)">2.11 Combat - Primus Modifiers</div>
        
        <div class="substep" data-detail="When you would gain your reward for defeating a primus, see the Primus Sheet which outlines your reward options. This replaces the normal reward. You will receive four total rewards each time you defeat a primus, with several rewards offering two options. Working down the list, select your four rewards. (Mercury Boots Rulesheet p. 12)">2.12 Combat - Primus Rewards</div>
        
        <div class="substep" data-detail="The stats that can be upgraded match those that can be upgraded in successful Bloodshed events: Attack (add or upgrade a die), Leadership, Health, Navigation, or Opportunity Capacity. These upgrades help your hero grow stronger for the challenges ahead. (Mercury Boots Rulesheet p. 12)">2.13 Rewards - Hero Stat Upgrade</div>
        
        <div class="substep" data-detail="To collect an opportunity reward, discard any opportunity in your camp and collect the reward listed on it. This provides strategic flexibility in choosing which opportunities to use for rewards. (Mercury Boots Rulesheet p. 12)">2.14 Rewards - Opportunity Reward</div>
        
        <div class="substep" data-detail="You may recruit a rival unit in the same way as you would when resolving a Sport event reward, recruiting any non-elite rival unit from among the rival's defeated units or those still in the arena from that combat. This expands your available forces. (Mercury Boots Rulesheet p. 12)">2.15 Rewards - Recruit a Rival</div>
        
        <div class="substep" data-detail="In Mercury Boots, ignore the Pluto's Domain section on the Vesuvians arena reference which adds banes equal to the number of Vesuvians left in the faction stack. Instead, gain 1 bane for each primus you have left undefeated. This creates a different strategic challenge. (Mercury Boots Rulesheet p. 13)">2.16 Scion Combat - Bane Generation</div>
        
        <div class="substep" data-detail="You no longer face primuses at the end of each act. Instead, you can end an act on any location, and you simply move into the next act once you've finished the previous one. Scion influence gain is still tied to your current act, but difficulty modifiers within the game are not and are instead tied to the defeat of primuses. (Mercury Boots Rulesheet p. 6)">2.17 Game Structure - Act Progression</div>
        
        <div class="substep" data-detail="As normal, you must wait until Act IV to face the scion, and you must face and defeat the scion before the end of Act IV in order to win the game!
