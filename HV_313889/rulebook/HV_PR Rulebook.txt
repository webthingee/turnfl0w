Introduction
The heavens have split open, and new evils have come rushing out. Pluto’s deadly games with the realm of mankind have just
changed forever.
Pandora’s Ruin brings a wealth of new content to the world of Hoplomachus: Victorum, adding to the vast options offered
by the core game. This expansion features new scions, new arena rules, new primus events, scion-specific events, and an
expedited play mode.
The content of this box is broken up into five different modules, as detailed in this book. The modules can be added to your
game of Hoplomachus: Victorum individually or all together.

    Faces of Evil
    Faces of Evil adds four new scions to your game, some from the franchise’s existing mythologies and some from
    lands and myths previously unexplored in Hoplomachus.

    Rules
    Add the components for the four new scions from this expansion in with the components for the existing scions
    from Hoplomachus: Victorum. When choosing a scion during Rival Setup, you may choose any of the four scions from
    this expansion in place of a scion from the base game box. Gather all of the components for the chosen scion as listed
    in the Contents section. Carry out the rest of setup and the game as normal.

Dark Days
The world is changing. Evil is seeping through the cracks that separate the gods from the mortals, and that evil is
working its way across the land, infecting everywhere you’ve ever been or might wish to go. Dark Days introduces
scion-specific event cards to shuffle into your existing event decks. Your chosen scion’s presence will be felt throughout
your game, providing extra challenges and difficult scenarios well before you come face-to-face with your foe.


Components




Special Unit Chips (10)     Special Tactic Chips (7)           Event Cards (117)              Prowess Cards (13)
                                                            • 39 Sport Event Cards
                                                         • 39 Bloodshed Event Cards
                                                       • 39 Opportunity Event Cards
Rules
Place the new special units and tactics in any empty space available in a chip tray, and add the new special prowesses
in with the existing ones. Keep the event cards from this expansion sorted by scion and separate from the rest of
your event cards. The name of the scion is listed at the top of the card. After selecting the scion you will face in Rival
Setup, find the nine event cards associated with the selected scion. There should be three of each event type—Sport,
Opportunity, and Bloodshed. Shuffle these events into the appropriate decks. Carry out the rest of setup and the
game as normal.



Strange Sands
Step into once-familiar arenas to discover new secrets in each locale. This set of arena cards adds a brand-new way to
play each arena, featuring the arena’s original rules on one side and its new rules on the other. The new arena rules
will challenge you to diversify your tactics as you reckon with a plethora of new, diabolical forces.


Components




  Double-Sided Arena Reference Cards (8)                    2 Arena Elite Chips (Thick)            Arena Chips (7)



Rules
Replace the four arena references that came in Hoplomachus: Victorum with the eight from this expansion. Each time
you move into a new region, take that region’s arena reference and place it with side A face up. When you enter into
a combat, use the side of the arena reference that is face up. At the end of each combat, flip the arena reference to its
other side. Therefore, until you leave that region, your combats will alternate between side A and side B.



                                                                                                                             3
    The Rivals
    Spice up your act-ending battles against the would-be heroes of the ancient world. The Rivals adds a Primus Event
    deck to the game, making each primus combat more varied and unique.


    Components




                                                 Primus Event Cards (15)


    Rules
    Add the Primus Event deck to your game in addition to the existing event decks. During game setup, shuffle the
    Primus Event deck and place it face up to the right of the stadium seating. As with the other decks, the top card of
    the Primus Event deck is meant to be visible, and you may use that information to your advantage leading up to the
    primus combat. Each time you move to a capital to face a primus, draw the top card from this deck. It is the event
    card for the primus combat.
    The following rules regarding primus combats are altered when using this deck:
        •   Use the lineups on the event card rather than the prescribed lineups in the Hoplomachus: Victorum rulebook.
        •   Use the Health printed on the primus chips rather than that shown in the rulebook.
        •   Act modifiers are not ignored in primus combats.
    Additionally, you may now enter any region’s capital, even if not initiating a primus or scion combat. If you do not
    initiate a combat, you must spectate. Carry out the steps of spectating as normal, with the primus deck being the
    deck that corresponds to capital locations. This allows you to cycle the top card and have more control over which
    primus combats you face.

Mercury’s Boots Rules
The Mercury’s Boots module for Hoplomachus: Victorum introduces an accelerated way to experience your epic,
gladiatorial campaign, trimming the journey to a maximum of 24 weeks and speeding things up accordingly in
a variety of ways. It is recommended that players be familiar with the rules of Hoplomachus: Victorum before
attempting this way to play, as these rules build off of that understanding.


Setup
The setup steps for Mercury’s Boots are very similar to those of a standard game of Hoplomachus: Victorum. For your
convenience, we have provided the setup in its entirety so you don’t have to switch between this rulebook and the
rules for Victorum. Setup steps that differ from Victorum’s normal setup are highlighted in blue.

Gameplay
The goal of Mercury’s Boots remains the same as Victorum’s goal: to grow strong and defeat the scion lurking atop
Vesuvius before your time is up. A number of aspects of that journey, however, have changed. These changes are
outlined below.


The Structure of Play
You now have a maximum of 24 weeks to complete this journey, with each act taking six weeks instead of 12.
As an additional structural change, you no longer face primuses at the end of each act, instead facing them whenever
you wish. See the Primuses section for more details on this.
You must play through the full six weeks of Acts I, II, and III, and you simply move into the next act once you’ve
finished the previous one. You can end an act on any location.
Scion influence gain is still tied to your current act, but difficulty modifiers within the game are not and are instead
tied to the number of primuses you have defeated.
As normal, you must wait until Act IV to face the scion, and you must face and defeat the scion before the end of Act
IV in order to win the game!


Navigation
Your Navigation Stat determines how many map spots you can travel during each Travel Phase. This allows you to
traverse the land faster. It can be upgraded to a maximum of 4.
You must move at least one spot during the Travel Phase, but you are not required to use your full Navigation. As
normal, you cannot travel back along the path you most recently traveled. There is no exception to this at the start
of each act, unlike in the base game. You also cannot move onto or through the same location twice in the same
Travel Phase.
You may move over capital locations. Only finishing your Travel Phase on a capital location triggers a primus/scion
fight. You cannot land on a capital location if there is not a primus/scion to fight there.
You must land on a harbor in order to use it; you cannot use a harbor mid-navigation.


Opportunities
When you accept an Opportunity event, draw up to three cards from the Opportunity Deck, ensuring you do not
exceed your Opportunity Capacity as indicated on your hero tracking pad. Your Opportunity Capacity can be
upgraded to a maximum of 5. Keep all Opportunity cards in your camp face up. Ignore all text on the face of the card
with the exception of the reward text. Opportunities can be used in two different, new ways in Mercury’s Boots.
First, you may discard an Opportunity card during combat directly after any die roll. This causes the entire roll to be
re-rolled. You must either accept the new roll or spend another Opportunity for another re-roll. This re-roll happens
before any skill or effect is triggered off of the die roll. Any die roll during combat can be re-rolled, whether on behalf
of the player, the rival, or even rolls not tied to a specific troop. This includes attacks as well as die rolls as part of
skill or event resolution.
The second use of Opportunity cards is that they can be spent when collecting primus rewards in order to obtain the
reward on the card. See the Primus Rewards section for more details.


Sport Events
When the tribune is defeated, your hero’s HP is not reduced. Instead, you immediately gain scion influence equal to
the current act.
When you win a Sport event, you are granted both rewards of recruiting a rival unit and gaining tactics, rather than
only one of these rewards.




                                                                                                                              7
    Bloodshed Events
    Bloodshed events are carried out as normal. When you win a Bloodshed event, increasing your Navigation Stat or
    Opportunity Capacity are new reward options you may choose, in addition to the already existing upgrade options.
    You still only get one reward in total.


    Primuses
    You may challenge any number of primuses, up to all seven, during your journey. Challenging a primus requires
    landing on a capital location containing an undefeated primus, as normal.
    Defeating a primus grants massive rewards which help your hero take a big step forward. However, doing so
    also marks an increase in difficulty for the rest of the game. Be sure to look over the reference sheet carefully to
    understand the risks and rewards.
    For events that require a random unused primus, if you have no unused primuses (from Hoplomachus: Remastered
    or expansions), use a random defeated primus. If none are defeated, use a random undefeated primus but return it
    with the other undefeated primuses at the end of the event.

    PRIMUS LINEUP                                                 Hero Stat Upgrade
    The reference sheet dictates the lineups for each primus      The stats that can be upgraded match those that can be
