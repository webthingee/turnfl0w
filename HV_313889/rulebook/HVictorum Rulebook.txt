How to Play   v1.1
    A Note from CTG
    Revisiting the Hoplomachus franchise was a tricky prospect. On the one hand, we wanted to bring all the games we’d
    released in our first game lineup to our current standards of production and design. On the other hand, we wanted
    to do something fresh and new, something exciting that speaks to where board gaming is today and where it’s
    heading tomorrow.
    Our approach was to launch two games at once. This one, Hoplomachus: Victorum, is a synthesis of the very best
    close-quarters combat inspired by Hoplomachus Origins and a recognition of the growing community of solo gamers
    — a community that we’ve always supported, and one that has supported us in kind. We wanted to create a truly
    epic experience for solo immersion, a concept that felt like dropping in to your very own cinematic gladiator story,
    complete with mythological trappings that feel like nothing else in this gaming space.
    We’re so pleased at the outcome. Hoplomachus: Victorum is one of the coolest games we’ve ever made, with lush art,
    nail-biting battles, and deep strategic choices that can mean the difference between glorious victory or agonizing
    defeat. It’s jam-packed with replayability, too, and we can’t wait to hear stories of all the ways players have hacked
    their way to victory against our collection of scions.
    The stuffed nature of the Victorum box is largely thanks to our Kickstarter backers, who smashed Victorum to
    crowdfunding success far exceeding our expectations. There are scions and heroes in the core box that we’d once
    considered as expansions down the road, but as you felled stretch goal after stretch goal, we felt we owed it to you to
    pack everything in. We wanted to plan for the future for Hoplo, but it’s our fans who actually paved the way for it,
    and we’re so grateful. We hope you love playing this as much as we loved making it.

    The Story (So Far)
    The year is AD 79, and Roman sage Pliny the Elder has learned of the imminent eruption of Mount Vesuvius.
    Seeking to save thousands of lives in the nearby cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum, he invokes the Eleusinian
    Mysteries, a series of ancient rites that allow him to communicate with Proserpina, goddess of the underworld.
    Proserpina bestows her mercy upon those who live near the volcano and forestalls the eruption – but Pluto, lord of
    the underworld, is not pleased.
    Angered that he has been robbed of new souls for his domain, Pluto gives the world’s mortals an ultimatum. In one
    year, he will trigger a new eruption at Vesuvius, this one powerful enough to blanket the entire planet in molten rock
    and ash. The only way humanity can avoid this fate is if the Earth’s strongest warriors best Pluto’s seven dread scions
    in combat – and defeat Pluto himself. Around the world, the champions of many great civilizations have begun
    amassing followers, seeking to destroy the scions, save the world and cement their own legend forever.
    Seven nations in particular have thrown their resources into fending off the apocalypse. The Roman Empire has
    thrown its weight behind the mysterious warrior Decimus and his New Argonauts, a group of dedicated warriors
    who believe traditional gladiatorial combat is the key for victory. China’s Han Dynasty has called for aid from
    master staff fighter Bingqing and the other inhabitants of Kunlun, a magical mountain that is home to the nation’s
    foremost practitioners of martial and mystic arts. The Parthian Empire has rallied around an enigmatic figure
    known only as The Parthian, a legendary equestrian who commands the respect of the Empire’s most elite military
    units. Warriors have even come from across the ocean in the form of Sea Strider and his Lamosian forces, keen to
    prove that they are worthy children of Neptune.
    Human nations are not the only ones working against the underworld. The mighty Amazons have sought the aid
    of Virago, master of the battle axe. The Atlanteans have risen from their aquatic isolation to begrudgingly aid the
    renegade Krakenlance, who mingles with the people of the world more than his kin would approve. Finally, Pluto is
    also contested by a creature named Stygiana, who leads a group from the underworld itself: A faction called Pluto’s
    Refugees, made up of those who escaped from the underworld to Antarctica when Pliny used his rites to pierce the
    veil between this world and the next.
    And, behind it all, there is yet an eighth faction: that of Nox, the goddess of night, who seeks to slay Pluto and take
    the underworld for herself. No matter the ultimate victor of this battle with the gods, the fate of the world hangs in
    the balance.



    You are a Hero!
    Victorum is a solo game of adventure and arena combat in the world of ancient mythology. Victorum is similar to
    other games in the Hoplomachus series. Although these rules contain everything you need to play, those who’ve
    played other Hoplomachus titles will find familiar rules alongside new ones.



    Overview
    Victorum is played as a campaign—a monumental epic that tells your hero’s story.
    To win a campaign, your hero must defeat three primuses and then prevail in battle at Mount Vesuvius against one
    of Pluto’s scions — or even Pluto himself! To do this, you will travel the ancient world competing in events, fighting
    in arenas, growing your forces, and developing your capabilities wisely.
    A campaign has four acts. Each act leads up to your confrontation with one of the three primuses, or with Pluto’s
    scion.
    Each act takes place over the course of up to 12 weeks. In each week, something dramatic happens — you might fight
    fearsome rivals, cross the ancient world, or wage a contest of skill against a local tribune.
    If your hero is ever defeated, you lose the game.
    The epic nature of Victorum means that you may not always be able to finish a campaign in one sitting. The breaks
    between acts are the best times to save the game, right after you defeat a primus. When you’re ready for a break,
    refer to “Saving the Game” on page 34.

The Most
Important Rules
Like the greatest arenas of antiquity, Victorum is supported by a solid foundation. Its cornerstone rules are:
    •   The rulebook’s precedence: This rulebook, and its official online errata and frequently asked question
        lists, are the definitive source of the rules of Victorum.
    •   Component-based exceptions: The rules on individual components — such as those that appear on cards,
        arena references, and scion references — supersede the rulebook by creating exceptions.
    •   The word “cannot:” The word “cannot” in a component effect means that effect can’t be overruled by
        another game effect.
    •   The word “may:” The word “may” always indicates a choice you can freely make.
    •   No peeking: Most components in this game are open information. With the exception of those listed below,
        all of the cards and chips can be looked through at any time.
                 Event card decks (except the frontmost face up card of each deck)
                 Faction stacks (except the frontmost face up chip of each stack)
                 Bane stack



Game References
There are a few pieces of reference material that you should be aware of as you read these rules and play the game.
First is the Unit Skills reference, which is a full-sized PVC sheet separate from this rulebook. It features all of the
definitions for skills found on unit chips in both this game and Hoplomachus: Remastered. Second is the Quick
Reference on the back of this rulebook. This features game information that you will need frequently, reducing your
need to refer back to the inside of the rulebook during the game. Lastly is the Key Terms on pages 35–37. This
is a list of definitions for important terms in this game. If you come across a term or concept you are unfamiliar
with, the Key Terms list is a great place to look.

     In this example, it is the start of rival’s turn partway through combat. For
       the Rival Deployment Step, the Archer is the topmost unit in the rival’s
     camp. Since there are rival deployment hexes available, it will deploy onto
                   the lowest available one – in this case, hex #1.



     Rival Tactic Placement Step
     In this step, place the next rival tactic chip that has a
     valid target, if possible. The rival places one tactic per
     turn at most.
     As with rival units, rival tactics are evaluated for
     placement in order, running down the column of
     tactics in the rival camp from top to bottom. The
     second tactic in the column is only evaluated if the first                     Carrying on with the previous combat example, it is now the rival’s Tactic

  This is the priority list for rival units in the Atlanteans arena. In this
   arena, all rival units use the same list, but this is not the case for all   Even though you are allowed to freely choose the
 arenas. Here, rival units’ first priority is your flagholder (in a Capture     order in which rival units move, you must return to
 the Flag event), then the trident chip if it is not currently equipped (the    move units that could not move earlier as the tactical
  trident is a special arena chip used in the Atlanteans arena), then an
 opponent holding the trident, then the farthest opponent within reach.
                                                                                situation changes. That is, you cannot leave a unit

There are two kinds of behaviors related to priorities:                         when it literally can’t move. For example, if a rival unit

Marking is the behavior that is relevant during the                             Rival Movement Example:
Movement Step. To move, a rival unit checks the arena’s
priority list and follows this procedure:
    1.    Identify a Mark. Determine the highest
          priority target the rival unit can reach. The unit
          can reach a bold priority mark if it can move
          onto a hex that is within Range of the marked
          unit. It can reach a non-bold priority if it can
          move onto its hex. Note that the rival assesses
          only the units within reach when determining
          its mark. So if its mark is, for example, the
          strongest opponent, it marks the strongest                                                                         ADRENALINE

          multiple marks of equal priority, they choose
          the closest one. If multiple possible marks have
          equal priority and distance, you may freely
          choose that unit’s mark. If no priority can be

     Rival Engage Step
     In this step, rival units either attack or use their Special
     skills. You may freely choose the order in which they
     act, but each rival must attack or use a Special if it can.
     When you select a rival unit to act, follow this procedure:
          1.    If the rival unit has a Special skill, check
                whether the conditions apply for that skill to be
                triggered (see the Unit Skills reference). If they
                do, that unit uses its Special skill instead of
                attacking, targeting its highest possible bolded
                priority. Once the Special is resolved, this rival                       It is time for the rival’s Engage Step. Again, you can resolve the units in

                      •     To attack, the rival unit gathers the
                            attack dice shown on its chip, applying
                            the effects of any relevant modifiers

not required to set aside your lineup ahead of time;
you may choose which unit from your camp to deploy
directly before deploying it.
If you have already deployed your entire lineup, you
cannot deploy any additional units. Similarly, if your
hero is the only undeployed unit from your lineup, you
must either choose your hero or forego a deployment.
If a deployment hex is blocked, you may not deploy a
unit there. If all your deployment hexes are blocked,
you cannot deploy a unit this turn.

             When one of those things happens, the tactic
             is discarded. You can lift a unit chip at any

      Let’s look at an example of the scion combat turn using Hydra. At this
      point in the combat, Hydra is already deployed and there are no other
              units to deploy, so the Rival Deployment Step is skipped.
     Hydra rolls 2 green dice, 3 blue dice, and 4 yellow dice per the dice icons       You now resolve the blue dice, of which there are 3 hits. This causes Hydra

     It’s a good idea to sort the dice by color and order them in the same order
                                                                                         Lastly, you must resolve the yellow dice. There is 1 hit, so each Hydra

        With 1 hit rolled, each Hydra’s Head (represented by banes) moves 1
      hex toward their marks. Top priority is Krakenlance, and the lower left
       Head that can get adjacent to him does so. The rightmost unit cannot
     reach Krakenlance, but is already adjacent to the next priority, with the
