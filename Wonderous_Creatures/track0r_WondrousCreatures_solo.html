Each player follows their own turn structure: you perform Basic Actions and Free Actions, while Tingent follows its automated card-driven actions. The game ends when all Trophies are depleted. (Rulebook p. 22-23)">1. Solo Game Turn Overview</div>
        
        <div class="step player-turn" data-detail="Your turn works exactly like the multiplayer game. Choose 1 Basic Action (Place Crew Member, Play Cards, Complete Achievement, or Recharge) and perform any number of Free Actions (Use Butterfly Net, Use Energy). You follow all normal rules for resource management, card costs, and abilities. (Rulebook p. 17)">2. Your Turn (Player)</div>
        <div class="substep player-turn" data-detail="Choose exactly one of the four Basic Actions available to you on your turn. You must perform exactly one Basic Action - you cannot pass your turn. • Place a Crew Member: deploy a worker on the map to gather resources or cards from adjacent Habitats. • Play a Card(s): play up to 2 cards from your hand by paying their resource costs. • Complete an Achievement: claim an available achievement slot for immediate rewards and end-game points. • Recharge: return all 3 crew members to your board when they're all deployed on the map. (Rulebook p. 17)">2.1 Choose 1 Basic Action</div>
        <div class="substep player-turn" data-detail="Perform as many Free Actions as desired at any time during your turn. Free Actions can be used before, during, or after your Basic Action. • Use a Butterfly Net: collect an adjacent Egg or activate an adjacent Special Effect Icon. • Use an Energy: discard an Energy from a card to activate that card's ability. (Rulebook p. 17-19)">2.2 Perform Free Actions (Optional)</div>
        <div class="substep player-turn" data-detail="At the end of your turn, refill any empty spaces in the Wilderness by drawing from the deck. If you depleted the last Trophy, each remaining player (including Tingent) takes one final turn, then the game ends. Otherwise, Tingent takes its turn next. (Rulebook p. 20)">2.3 End Turn / Check Game End</div>

        <div class="step tingent-turn" data-detail="Tingent's turn is automated and follows a specific sequence. Tingent does not use resources, energies, or butterfly nets. It only places 2 Crew members (never removes them), collects cards and eggs based on Achievement targets, and never pays costs or activates abilities. All actions are driven by Tingent Cards. (Rulebook p. 22-23)">3. Tingent's Turn (AI)</div>
        <div class="substep tingent-turn" data-detail="Draw the top card from the Tingent Card deck and place it face-up on top of any previously drawn cards. If the deck runs out, shuffle all Tingent Cards to create a new deck. This card determines all of Tingent's actions for this turn. (Rulebook p. 23)">3.1 Draw Tingent Card</div>
        <div class="substep tingent-turn" data-detail="Look at the Tingent Tracker position on the Tingent Board. If it's on a Yellow Gear space, activate the Yellow Area of the card. If it's on a Brown Gear space, activate the Brown Area. The card shows different actions (place crew, take cards, gain eggs) based on which area is active. (Rulebook p. 23)">3.2 Activate Card Based on Tracker Position</div>
        <div class="substep tingent-turn" data-detail="If the Tingent Card shows a Red Gear icon in the center, advance the Tingent Tracker one space on the Tingent Board. When the tracker reaches the first Brown Gear space, flip all Tingent Cards to their brown side - future turns will use Brown Areas instead of Yellow Areas. (Rulebook p. 23)">3.3 Advance Tingent Tracker (if Red Gear present)</div>
        <div class="substep tingent-turn" data-detail="If the Tingent Tracker advanced to a space with an icon, immediately resolve its effect. Some effects help Tingent score points. • Discovery: place Habitat Tile on leftmost Lake hex with an Egg, Tingent gains that Egg. • Time Track Advance: advance Time Track by 1 space and apply any Time Track effects. • Complete Achievement: place Achievement Marker on targeted Achievement and take Trophy. (Rulebook p. 25)">3.4 Resolve Tracker Icon Effect (if present)</div>

        <div class="step tingent-turn" data-detail="Tingent places its Captain or regular Crew member on the Map based on the activated card area. It seeks to maximize adjacent Habitats matching the card's requirements, gains VPs for matching adjacent Habitats, and collects any Eggs on placement hexes. Tingent cannot place on Mountains and never removes Crew from the Map. (Rulebook p. 24)">4. Tingent Crew Placement Actions</div>
        <div class="substep tingent-turn" data-detail="If the card shows a Captain icon, place Tingent's Captain on the Map where it can be adjacent to the most Habitats of the type shown on the card. Tingent immediately gains 1 VP for each adjacent Habitat that matches the card requirement (not all adjacent Habitats). (Rulebook p. 24)">4.1 Captain Placement (if Captain icon)</div>
        <div class="substep tingent-turn" data-detail="If the card shows a regular Crew icon, place Tingent's regular Crew member where it can be adjacent to the most Habitats of the type shown. Use tiebreaker rules if multiple locations are equal. • Step 1: Place where adjacent to most other Habitats beyond the required type. • Step 2: If still tied, place where adjacent to most Special Effect Icons. • Step 3: If still tied, place where adjacent to most Eggs. • Step 4: If still tied, you choose for Tingent. (Rulebook p. 24)">4.2 Regular Crew Placement (if Crew icon)</div>
        <div class="substep tingent-turn" data-detail="If there's an Egg on the hex where Tingent places its Crew member, Tingent collects that Egg and places it in the Tingent Area. Tingent does not gain Egg Storage Rewards and can hold unlimited Eggs. If no valid placement exists, draw a new Tingent Card. (Rulebook p. 24)">4.3 Collect Egg on Placement Hex (if present)</div>

        <div class="step tingent-turn" data-detail="Tingent collects Creature Cards and Eggs based on its Achievement targets and card requirements. It takes specific cards from the Wilderness (face-up) or draws from the deck (face-down), and gains matching Eggs from the Supply. Face-up cards count toward species Achievements while face-down provide end-game points. (Rulebook p. 24)">5. Tingent Card and Egg Collection</div>
        <div class="substep tingent-turn" data-detail="If the card shows this icon, draw 1 card from the Creature Card deck and place it face-down in the Tingent Area. Face-down cards don't help with Achievements but provide VPs at game end based on Tingent's difficulty level (1-3 VPs per card). (Rulebook p. 24)">5.1 Draw Face-Down Card (if Draw icon)</div>
        <div class="substep tingent-turn" data-detail="If the card shows this icon, take a card from the Wilderness that matches the species icon of the Achievement with the corresponding Target Token color. Choose the card with highest Ending Score, or leftmost if tied. If no matching cards exist, draw face-down instead. (Rulebook p. 24)">5.2 Take Face-Up Card from Wilderness (if Take icon)</div>
        <div class="substep tingent-turn" data-detail="If the card shows this icon and Tingent just took a face-up card, take an Egg from the Supply matching one of the species icons on the card Tingent just acquired. If the card has 2 species icons, use the one that matches the Target Token Achievement. Place the Egg in Tingent Area. (Rulebook p. 24)">5.3 Gain Matching Egg (if Egg icon)</div>

        <div class="step tingent-turn" data-detail="When Tingent's Tracker lands on certain spaces, it can automatically complete Achievements following special rules. Tingent doesn't pay costs, doesn't hatch Eggs, and can complete lower slots unconditionally unless you block them. It needs sufficient face-up species icons for upper slots. (Rulebook p. 25)">6. Tingent Achievement Completion</div>
        <div class="substep tingent-turn" data-detail="When triggered by Tracker icon, Tingent places an Achievement Marker on the Main Achievement where its Brown Target Token is located. It chooses upper slot if available, otherwise lower slot. Take a Trophy for Tingent and move the Brown Target Token to the next Main Achievement (or leave if none remain). (Rulebook p. 25)">6.1 Complete Main Achievement</div>
        <div class="substep tingent-turn" data-detail="When triggered by Tracker icon, Tingent attempts to complete the Single-Species or Multi-Species Achievement with the matching Target Token color. It can always take lower slots unless you occupy them. For upper slots, it needs enough face-up cards and Eggs with matching species icons. (Rulebook p. 25)">6.2 Complete Species Achievement</div>
        <div class="substep tingent-turn" data-detail="Tingent follows special Achievement placement rules based on available slots and species count. Count species icons from face-up cards and all Eggs in Tingent's area. • If Tingent has enough icons for upper slot and it's available: place marker in upper slot. • If upper slot occupied by you but lower slot available: Tingent takes lower slot. • If you occupy lower slot and Tingent can't reach upper requirement: Tingent forfeits this Achievement entirely. • Tingent never hatches Eggs when completing Achievements. (Rulebook p. 25)">6.3 Apply Achievement Placement Rules</div>
        <div class="substep tingent-turn" data-detail="When Tingent completes any Achievement, it takes a Trophy from the Main Board and places it in the Tingent Area. Move the corresponding Target Token to the next Achievement Card of the same type. If no more cards of that type exist, the Target Token stays in place. (Rulebook p. 25)">6.4 Take Trophy and Move Target Token</div>

        <div class="step" data-detail="After both you and Tingent have taken your turns, check if all Trophies have been depleted from the Main Board. If so, finish any remaining final turns and proceed to scoring. If not, continue with the next round starting with your turn. Refill the Wilderness if needed before continuing. (Rulebook p. 25)">7. Round End and Game Continuation</div>
        <div class="substep" data-detail="Check if any player (you or Tingent) took the last Trophy during their turn. If you took it, Tingent gets one final turn then game ends. If Tingent took it, the game ends immediately. If Trophies remain, continue to the next round with your turn. (Rulebook p. 25)">7.1 Check for Game End Trigger</div>
        <div class="substep" data-detail="If the game continues, make sure the Wilderness has 6 cards by drawing from the deck to fill any empty spaces. If the deck runs out, shuffle the discard pile. Then begin the next round with your turn, following the same alternating sequence. (Rulebook p. 11)">7.2 Refill Wilderness and Continue</div>

(Rulebook p. 22)">1. Solo Mode Setup Overview</div>
        <div class="substep" data-detail="Use the 2-player side of the Main Board (Side-A). Place the Supply Board above it.

Tingent scores differently than normal players - it gets points for face-up cards, Achievements, Trophies, and Eggs, plus bonus points for face-down cards based on difficulty level. Compare final scores to determine the winner. (Rulebook p. 25)">1. Solo Game Scoring Overview</div>
        
        <div class="step" data-detail="Calculate your final score exactly as in multiplayer games. Add End Card scores, all card Ending Scores, Achievement Slot scores, 3 VPs per Trophy, and 1 VP per 4 resources/Butterfly Nets. Use Score Tokens if you exceed 50 VPs. This is your final score to compare against Tingent. (Rulebook p. 20-21)">2. Your Score Calculation (Normal Rules)</div>
        <div class="substep" data-detail="Activate all End Cards in your reserve and gain their VPs based on your collection. For example, if you have an End Card giving 1 VP per Crustacean and you have 8 Crustaceans total, gain 8 VPs. Add all End Card scores together. (Rulebook p. 20)">2.1 End Card Scores</div>
        <div class="substep" data-detail="Add the Ending Score (red seal number) from every Creature Card in your reserve. These are the base victory points printed on each card that you played during the game. Do not count abilities here, just the printed numbers. (Rulebook p. 20)">2.2 Creature Card Ending Scores</div>
        <div class="substep" data-detail="Add the Ending Score from each Achievement Slot you completed during the game. Each Achievement shows different VP values for upper and lower slots. Count the specific slot you claimed, not the total Achievement card value. (Rulebook p. 20)">2.3 Achievement Slot Scores</div>
        <div class="substep" data-detail="Count all Trophies you collected and multiply by 3 VPs each. Trophies are primarily gained from completing Achievements, but can also come from reaching 30 and 50 VPs on the Score Track during the game. (Rulebook p. 20)">2.4 Trophy Scores (3 VPs each)</div>

        <div class="substep" data-detail="Tingent does not activate End Card abilities like normal players. Instead, each face-up End Card in Tingent's area provides exactly 5 VPs regardless of its normal effect. This simplifies Tingent's scoring while still giving value to End Cards.

        <div class="substep" data-detail="Count all Trophies in Tingent's area and multiply by 3 VPs each.

        <div class="substep" data-detail="Count all Eggs in Tingent's area (both face-up cards earned and Eggs gained from Supply) and gain 1 VP per Egg. Unlike normal players, Tingent scores 1 VP per Egg rather than using them for Achievement requirements only. (Rulebook p. 25)">3.5 Egg Scores (1 VP each)</div>
        <div class="substep" data-detail="Count all face-down cards in Tingent's area and gain VPs based on the difficulty level you chose during setup. Higher difficulties make Tingent score more points for these cards. • Lazy Tingent: 1 VP per face-down card. • Easygoing Tingent: 2 VPs per face-down card. • Wild Tingent: 3 VPs per face-down card. • Terrifying Tingent: 3 VPs per face-down card.

Determine Winner</div>
        <div class="substep" data-detail="Add up all scoring categories for both you and Tingent. The player with the higher total score wins the solo game.
